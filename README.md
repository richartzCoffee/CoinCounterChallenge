[Click here](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)


## code

The code file contains the python scripts used to solve the challenge, while the DistributionFile/dist file contains the program's executable.

The images of dolar_original.png and real_original.jpg are placed in the mass of images, after the program starts an user interface is opened. The user selects which of the challenges he wants to perform, with the value 1 to run the challenge Contando moedas de Real  and 2 for Contando moedas de DÃ³lar  if he wants to leave the program, only digital 0, if the user has triggered challenges 1 or 2, to choose an exit function, the user must first close all open image guides during the process.
